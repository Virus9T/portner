# 🔍 Portner - Service Specific Payload-based Port Scanner

*Portner* is a custom Python-based port scanner that not only checks for open ports but also sends *service-specific payloads* to extract potential banners or protocol responses. This tool is designed for *educational and authorized testing purposes* only.

## 📦 Features

-  Falls back to a generic HTTP payload when no specific payload exists
